## Welcome

Welcome to Secure Coding & DevSecOps Fundamentals, there are 3 possible reasons to why you are here: you were hacked because of some vulnerabilities you had in code, or you want to prevent that, or you want to prevent that for someone else!

This course is designed to give you practical, hands-on skills for writing safer code, securing modern pipelines, and spotting vulnerabilities before attackers do. We’ll be working with real tools, real code, and real-world examples

## What you’ll learn
- The core principles of secure coding and how to apply them
- How to use static and dynamic analysis tools to catch bugs
- How to secure your CI/CD pipelines and manage secrets properly
- Practical container and cloud security fundamentals
- How to threat model your applications and communicate findings effectively

## Tools we’ll use
We’ll be leaning on free/open-source tools so you can replicate everything at home

- **Semgrep** – static analysis
- **Snyk/Trivy** – dependency and container scanning
- **git-secrets / truffleHog** – secret detection
- **OWASP Juice Shop / DVWA** – vulnerable apps for practice
- **OWASP ZAP** – dynamic analysis
- **Docker & Kubernetes (optional)** – container labs

## Course Structure
The course is broken into 5 main sections:
- **Secure Coding Basics** – understand and fix common vulnerabilities.
- **Static Analysis & Dependencies** – catching issues early.
- **CI/CD & Secrets Management** – securing pipelines and credentials.
- **Containers & Cloud Security** – hardening modern infra.
- **Threat Modeling & Reporting** – big-picture thinking and communication.

## Getting Support
We’ll use GitHub Issues to ask questions, report bugs, and suggest improvements — just like in a real-world SOC environment where tracking and documentation are crucial.

### How to Ask for Help or Report a Bug
1. Go to the GitHub Repository
- Open the course repository in your browser ***(final URL)***

2. Click on the “Issues” Tab in the top-left

- You’ll see a list of existing issues, check if your problem has already been reported


3. Create a New Issue
- Click `New issue`
- Fill in the details, including: `What went wrong?`, `What were you doing?`, `What did you expect to happen?`, `Screenshot or terminal output`

4. Submit the issue
